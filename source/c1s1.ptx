    <title>Examples and Basic Notions</title>

    <p>We are surrounded by networks: social (Facebook, X, Instagram), 
    communication (airlines, trains, highways), biological (?), collaboration (Bacon movie or Erdos collaboration).
    In this section, we describe some examples and how one can use the tools of graph theory
    to model them.</p>

    <example>
        <p>
            An abstract view of a social network is to consider the people of the network as nodes or points
            in the plane and for any two people that friends, draw a line or curve between the points representing
            them.
        </p>

                A simple graph <m>G=(V,E)</m> consists of a set of vertices <m>V</m> and 
                a set of edges <m>E</m>, where each edge consists of two distinct vertices.

    <example>
        <p>The Bacon graph is the graph whose vertices are movie actors
            where two vertices/actors are adjacent if they 
            have appeared together in a movie. </p>
    </example>

    <example>
        <p>The Erdos collaboration graph is the graph whose vertices are 
            mathematicians where two vertices/mathematicians are adjacent 
            if they are co-authors on a math paper. </p>

    <remark>
       <p>Most of the examples we consider here are finite graphs, where V and E are both finite.</p>

                Let <m>G=(V,E)</m> be a graph. 
                For a vertex <m>x\in V</m>, the neighborhood <m>N_G(x)</m> (or <m>N(x)</m> if the graph
                <m>G</m> is clear from the context) of <m>x</m> is the set of neighbors of <m>x</m>:

                The degree <m>d_G(x)</m> (or <m>d(x)</m> if the graph <m>G</m> is clear 
                from the context) of x is defined as the number of edges that contain <m>x</m>,

    <p>We are ready for our first result. This is often called the Handshaking Lemma due
        to its interpretation.</p>

	Let <m>G=(V,E)</m> and <m>H=(W,F)</m> be two graphs. If <m>G</m> and <m>H</m> are isomorphic, then
