    <title>Examples</title>

    <p>We are surrounded by networks: social (Facebook, X, Instagram), 
    communcation (airlines, trains, highways), biological (?), collaboration (Bacon movie or Erdos collaboration).
    In this section, we describe some examples and how one can use the tools of graph theory
    to model them.</p>

                A graph <m>G=(V,E)</m> consists of a set of vertices <m>V</m> and a set of edges <m>E</m>, where each edge consists of

    <example>
        <p>The Bacon graph is the graph whose vertices are movie actors
            where two vertices/actors are adjacent if they 
            have appeared together in a movie. </p>
    </example>

    <example>
        <p>The Erdos collaboration graph is the graph whose vertices are 
            mathematicians where two vertices/mathematicians are adjacent 
            if they are co-authors on a math paper. </p>
    </example>



    <remark>
       <p>Most of the examples we consider here are finite graphs, where V and E are both finite.</p>

                Let <m>G=(V,E)</m> be a graph. For a vertex <m>x\in V</m> the degree <m>d(x)</m> of x is defined as the number of edges that contain <m>x</m>.

    <p>We are ready for our first result. This is often called the Handshaking Lemma due
        to its interpretation.</p>

    <theorem xml:id="thm1">
        <statement>
            <p>
                If <m>G=(V,E)</m> is a finite graph, then 
                <men xml:id="eq1">
                    \sum_{x\in V}d(x)=2|E|.
                </men>
                
            </p>
        </statement>
    </theorem>
    
    <p> The following is a consequence of 
     <xref ref="thm1"/>.</p>

    <corollary xml:id="cor1">
        <statement>
            <p>
              In any finite graph, the number of vertices with odd degree is even.  
            </p>
        </statement>
    </corollary>

    <definition xml:id="def-def2">
        <statement>
            <p>
            Two graphs <m>G = (V,E)</m> and <m>H=(W,F)</m> are isomorphic if 
            there is a bijective function <m>h: V\to W</m> such that
