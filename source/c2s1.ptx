                A graph <m>G=(V,E)</m> is called a tree if <m>G</m> 
                is connected and contains no cycles.

<proposition xml:id="prop-numberleaves-intree">
    <statement>
        <p>
            Every finite tree with at least 2 vertices contains at least 2 leaves.

<proposition xml:id="prop-trees-delete-leaf">
    <statement>
        <p>
           Deleting a leaf from a tree with <m>n\geq 2</m> vertices yields a tree with <m>n-1</m> vertices. 
        </p>
    </statement>
</proposition>
<proof>
    <p>
        Let <m>T</m> be a tree with <m>n\geq 2</m> vertices. Let <m>u</m> be a leaf in <m>T</m>. 
        We want to show that <m>T\backslash \{u\}</m> is acyclic (contains no cycle) and
        connected (there is a walk connecting any pair of vertices). 
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <m>T</m> is acyclic then <m>T\backslash \{u\}</m> is acyclic 
                    (Taking away a vertex will not create a new cycle).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Is <m>T\backslash \{u\}</m> connected? <p>
                    Take any two vertices <m>x,y, x\neq y</m> in <m>T\backslash \{u\}</m>. 
                    Because <m>T</m> is a tree, it is connected, there exists an <m>x-y</m> path in <m>T</m>. 
                    Note that the degree of vertices in the middle of the path is 2, 
                    so the removal of vertex <m>u</m> of degree 1 and the edge incident to it doesn't effect the path 
                    <m>x-y</m>. Thus, in <m>T\backslash \{u\}</m>, the vertices
                    <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are still connected by a path, hence <m>T\backslash \{u\}</m> is connected.
                </p> </p>

        </ol>
